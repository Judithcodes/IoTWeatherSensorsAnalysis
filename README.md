# Internet of Things (IoT) Weather Sensors Analysis

In this study, proposed "An Extended IoT Framework" learning part is presented with a use case on weather data clustering analysis.

LinkedSensorData and LinkedObservationData are used for use case scenario.

"LinkedSensorData is an RDF dataset containing expressive descriptions of ~20,000 weather stations in the United States."
"LinkedObservationData is an RDF dataset containing expressive descriptions of hurricane and blizzard observations in the United States."

They are converted from RDF to CSV file to process with ML algorithms.

Input Data Set: /SensorsDataSet

Output: /Results (that plots clusters and cluster detail information)

More details are explained soon..
